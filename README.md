# Jenkins-Dashboard
A build dashboard for jenkins for all who are no allowed to install jenkins plugins.

## Motivation
Target users are **NOT** admin-users who setting up their own jenkins, for a single project and are free to do whatever they want with their jenkins installation. Thy should have a look for the [Jenkins Build Monitor](https://github.com/jan-molak/jenkins-build-monitor-plugin/).
This application is for users with no admin access to jenkins and with no possibility to install or update plugins, like in companies where build server is provided as a service for all development teams.

The Jenkins Dashboard does'nt claim to be a full monitor of all builds and history, that is provided by jenkins itself, but should give a quick and easy overview if all builds are passed. You should be able to get this information while you just walk by the dashboard.
